                    Many applications consist of multiple services, such as a database, API service, and front-end.
                    Provisioning them as a single application in <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a>
                    can be challenging, especially if one or more services run outside your cluster.

                    The <strong>Ansible Broker</strong>, an implementation of the <a href="https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/" target="_blank">Open Service Broker API</a>,
                    was designed to simplify orchestration and management of Kubernetes applications using a lightweight,
                    container-based application definition called an
                    <a href="https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/ansible-playbook-bundle" target="_blank">Ansible Playbook Bundle (APB)</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    APBs are a method of modeling applications as a collection of
                    <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank">Ansible</a> Playbooks built into a
                    portable container with an Ansible runtime. Theyâ€™re designed to guide provisioning, binding
                    (connecting multiple services together into a larger application), and updating of simple to
                    complex services running both on- or off-platform.
