                        Many applications consist of multiple services, such as a database, API service, and front-end.
                        Provisioning them as a single application in Kubernetes can be challenging, especially if one or
                        more services run outside your cluster.

                        The Ansible Broker, an implementation of the Open Service Broker API, was designed to <strong>simplify
                        orchestration and management of Kubernetes applications</strong> using a lightweight,
                        container-based application definition called an Ansible Playbook Bundle (APB).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        APBs are a method of modeling applications as a collection of Ansible Playbooks built into a
                        portable container with an Ansible runtime. Theyâ€™re designed to guide provisioning, binding
                        (connecting multiple services together into a larger application), and updating of simple to
                        complex services running both on- or off-platform.

                <p>
                    As a developer, it's easy to get started using Ansible Broker if you have
                    <a href="https://www.openshift.org/index.html" target="_blank">OpenShift</a> up and running.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also offer a collection of Ansible playbooks called <a href="https://github.com/fusor/catasb">catasb</a>
                    to get you up and running faster with OpenShift or Kubernetes, the Service Catalog, and Ansible
                    Broker.
